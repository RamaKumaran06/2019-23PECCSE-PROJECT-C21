DETECT PROFESSIONAL MALICIOUS USER WITH METRIC LEARNING IN RECOMMENDERÂ SYSTEMS

In e-commerce, online retailers are usually suffering from professional malicious users (PMUS), who utilize negative reviews and low ratings to their consumed products on purpose to threaten the retailers for illegal profits. PMUS are difficult to be detected because they utilize masking strategies to disguise themselves as normal users. To this end, we propose an unsupervised multi-modal learning model: MMD, which employs Metric learning for professional Malicious users Detection with both ratings and reviews. MMD first utilizes a modified RNN to project the informational review into a sentiment score, which jointly considers the ratings and reviews. The extensive experiments in four datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can solve this unsupervised detection problem. Moreover, the performance of the state-of-the-art recommender models is enhanced by taking MMD as a preprocessing stage.
